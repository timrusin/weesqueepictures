There are some films that live because they were brilliant, and some because they were terrible, and some because of the moments in making them.  None of us had any idea what we were doing, we just did it, and it never failed to amaze me how wonderful everyone was. Even though we didn't use the soundtrack we recorded of all of us singing the song, Dan got his girlfriend to do a perfect version for us.",

I love this film, not for what it ended up being but for what I dreamed it could be.  Everyone working on it did great work, just exactly what was needed, but the end product did not gel right.",
